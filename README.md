Phishing Website Detection
Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques. The system uses URL features and content-based analysis to classify websites as phishing or legitimate. The goal is to create an accurate model that aids in identifying fraudulent websites to enhance online security.

Features
Dataset collection of phishing and legitimate URLs

Feature extraction from URLs and website content

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Web application for user input and real-time detection

Model persistence with Pickle for reuse

Installation
Clone the repository.

Create and activate a Python virtual environment.

Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Flask web application:

bash
python app.py
Open your browser and navigate to the local server address provided (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000).

Project Structure
app.py: Flask web app entry point.

model.pkl: Serialized trained machine learning model.

data/: Dataset folder (optional).

feature_extraction.py: Module to extract features from URLs.

train_model.py: Script for training the ML model.

Dataset
Phishing URLs were collected from PhishTank, while legitimate URLs came from open datasets such as the University of New Brunswick URL dataset.

Model
The model is trained using scikit-learn, often logistic regression or random forest classifiers, based on extracted features.

Future Work
Improve feature extraction with semantic analysis.

Deploy with a GUI or browser extension.

Incorporate deep learning models for enhanced accuracy.
